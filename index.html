      <h1><strong>The beginning</strong></h1>
        

    <p>     Blood, gore, vibrant colors.
         These are the key elements that hooked me into the show Invincible. 
          The show (released on Amazon prime) came out in a time where all media related to fiction was trying to be the next MCU,
           including the bone-dry humor.
           But then on March 26, 2021 Robert Kirkman threw us an unexpected fastball with this new animated series with an all-star cast 
           including the famous J.K Simmons! This show was a breath of fresh air for the entertainment industry,
           finally a good super hero show that was animated!

        Story synopsis: So far (without much spoilers) a teenager
         discovers him and his dad have amazing powers, flight, regeneration 
         (to a degree), and are able to withstand even the harshness of space.
          Now, usually the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, but not in this story. 
           (Anything else I say is spoilers).

    <h3>My Thoughts and hopes </h3>
    <img src="image\picture2.jpeg" alt="" />

    <p>My hopes for the future of the series; 
      I hope that we actually see Mark win a couple fights, 
      as he has a tendency to lose. I do hope that they set up 
      the black and blue suit, and in the comics while he wears 
      this he dogs on other characters  And I hope that the end 
      of this season sets up the invincible war, and if it does 
      then in season 4 I hope we get a cameo from spawn.   </p>
